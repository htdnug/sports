# Contributing

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Pull requests

Please open all pull requests with a clear title and description against 'dev' branch.

Please adhere to the coding guidelines used throughout the project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) 
and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

## Bug reports

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you down for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What
would you expect to be the outcome? 

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
